Maven has ~70% of the market for Java applications build tools
Is supported by all major IDEs
Is commonly used by large Open Source Projects (such as Spring Framework, Spring Boot, etc.)

Maven is very stable, releases happen about once or twice a year

## Advantadges
- Quick project Setup
	- Maven brins conventions over configuration, reducing setup time
- Projects are modular
- Mature dependency management
- Mature project build lifecycle
- Great plugin community

Also, maven has stablished "standards" that other build tools use, such as:
- Standard directory layout
- Artifcat naming
- Artifact repositories

Prior to maven, these "standards" did not exist
New build tools, such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), are compatible with these "standards"

## Disadvantadges
- Projects are described in an XML document, constrained by an XML Schema. Some people consider XML outdated
	- For instance, Gradle uses [Groovy DSL](http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html), wich can offer more flexibility
	- Generally it is rare to need that flexibility, since Maven is so mature it is likely that some functionality or plugin exists to solve a specific problem
